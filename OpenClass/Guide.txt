7. What is HardwareHaven?
It is a company dedicated to selling hardware. The idea was born in dark times, forged amidst cables and hope.
This company, specializing in PC components, was founded by Ignacio Rodríguez, a vocational electronic technician and instinctive dreamer.
In the toughest moments of the pandemic, when the world seemed to stop, Ignacio lit a spark among resistors and circuits. He started with modest spare parts but with a clear vision: to bring technology to those who needed it most, when it was needed most.
And so, between motherboards and RAM memories, an empire began to be built.
